# jblomlof-task-13
This was interesting at the very least. 

I'm not proud, but it's all i had time (and will) to do. However as a compensation I also did the java-task for this week. So hopefully if you think I did a lackluster job here, ignore this repo and look at the KTH-github.

### To run
Simply run the rust files with `cargo r`  
There will now be a `picture.ppm` file in your working directory (its the same one as in [ray-tracing/picture](ray-tracing/picture/picture.ppm)  
 Simply convert it or show it any software you like, and it will show you the same picture as [ray-tracing/picture/Picture.PNG](ray-tracing/picture/Picture.PNG))
